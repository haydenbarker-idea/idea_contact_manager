## 🎓 What We Learned

- Next.js standalone mode requires special handling for static files
- Image component needs `unoptimized` for uploaded photos
- Serving photos via API route bypasses static file limitations
- Environment variables must be checked before adding to avoid overwrites
- Asynchronous email/SMS sending prevents blocking the user experience
- PDF attachments work great with Resend
- Multi-channel follow-up dramatically increases engagement
