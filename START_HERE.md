./PUSH_TO_GITHUB.sh
```

git commit -m "Initial commit: Contact Exchange MVP"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

### Step 2: DNS Setup (5 minutes)
Go to your DNS provider and add:
- **Type**: A Record
- **Name**: contacts (or @)
- **Value**: `137.220.52.23`
- **TTL**: 300

Wait 5-10 minutes, then test:
```bash

```

---

### Step 3: Run Server Setup (10 minutes)
```bash
# Upload server setup script
scp server-setup-quick.sh root@137.220.52.23:/root/

# SSH and run
ssh root@137.220.52.23
chmod +x server-setup-quick.sh
sudo bash server-setup-quick.sh
```

Enter when prompted:
- Domain: `contacts.ideanetworks.com`
- Email: your-email@example.com

**💾 SAVE THE DATABASE PASSWORD!**

### Step 4: Deploy from GitHub (5 minutes)
```bash
# Still on server, upload and run deployment script
# From local machine:
scp deploy-from-github.sh root@137.220.52.23:/root/

# On server:
chmod +x deploy-from-github.sh
sudo bash deploy-from-github.sh https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
